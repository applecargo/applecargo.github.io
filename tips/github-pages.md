## github-pages

to have more than 1 account.. set up gitx.
to push, only command line possible.

first clone repo from github 'git clone'
then get into the folder
and do sth.
use gitx to commit.
push with 'git push -u origin master' <- then, this becomes default push relationship.

afterwards, just push with 'git push' is fine.
