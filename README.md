# applecargo.github.io

this repo has nothing.
but in the history this repo had several interesting things.
like, mdwiki.html based.. original applecargo.github.io site.. etc.
so, look into 'commits' and review.. and recover what is needed.
otherwise, also collect those and make separate repos.. if needed.

camino2017 is now separate: https://github.com/applecargo/camino2017

('space-package' is also has separate repo.. and that is not working yet.
and this one also doesn't work.. we need to work on it to make it work again.)
