Learning-Sensor-Access-in-JS
============================

Learning to access sensors in JavaScript. In case I (or you) ever need it - here it is:

[sensors.html](sensors.html)

It seems that on Samsung Galaxy Note the portion of the [W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/) (check it out - it's got nice examples) related to gyroscope was not working so I decided to leave this part of the code out.

See the example in action [here](https://rawgit.com/altermarkive/Learning-Sensor-Access-in-JS/master/sensors.html).
